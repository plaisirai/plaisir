<h4 align="center">Managed infra for building chatbots that can truly do back-and-forth and learn user preferences over time</h4>

<br /><br />
Easily build chatbots that:

- Are **quick to roll out**, with PlaisirAI abstracting away the logic for computing/storing embeddings & handling Q&A.
- **Gather new context**, if required, in every back-and-forth of a conversation.
- **Learn and utilize user preferences** across conversations.
- Help you improve the dataset used through **easy observability**.
- Can retrieve relevant information more effectively by **fine-tuning the embeddings model**.
